# JavaScript Module Template
This repository serves as an easy-start template for JavaScript/TypeScript NPM packages. 

Simply clone the repository into a directory:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:T99/js-module-template.git my-new-project
```

And then run the init script:

```bash
$ ./init.sh
```

The init script will interactively prompt you for package information and then automatically build the package, correct and fill-in package information, and install the specified NPM packages already included in the provided `package.json`.

And that's it! Your project is ready to go.
